//## Exercise 1
//Create a Person constructor function that has:
//* firstName
//* lastName
//* age
//* getFullName - method

//Create a Student constructor function that inherits from Person and has:
//* academyName
//* studentId
//* study - method that writes in the console: The student firstName is studying in the academyName

//Create two Student objects

function Person(firstName,lastName,age){
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
    this.getFullName = function(){
        console.log(`${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`);

        console.log(`The student ${this.firstName} ${this.firstName} is studying in the ${this.academyName}`);

    //Create a method on the Student prototype that accepts a 
    //Student of any academy and returns the academy that that student is in.
    this.studentsOfAnyAcademy = function() {
        if(student1.academyName !== "" ) {
            console.log(`Academy of student is ${this.academyName}`)
        } else {
            console.log("Enter correct Academy Name")
        }
    }

let student1 = new Student("Biba", "Radevska" ,35, "", 1);

let student2 = new Student("Vesna", "Minovska", 28, "SEDEC", 5);

console.log(student1.academyName);
student1.studentsOfAnyAcademy();


//## Exercise 2
//Create a method on the Student prototype that accepts a 
//Student of any academy and returns the academy that that student is in.


//Create DesignStudent, CodeStudent and NetworkStudent constructor functions that inherit from Student.

//#### DesignStudent
//* isStudentOfTheMonth - boolean

//#### CodeStudent
//* hasIndividualProject - boolean
//* hasGroupProject - boolean
//* doProject(type) - method that accepts string. If the string is 
//individual or group it should write that the person is working on the 
//project of that type and set the value to true on the property of the project

function CodeStudent(firstName,lastName,age,academyName,studentId,individualProject,groupProject) {

//#### NetworkStudent
//* academyPart - number
//* attendCiscoExam - method that writes in console: the student firstNAme is doing a cisco exam!

student5.attendCiscoExam();

//**Note:** For all students, the academyName property 
//should be auto generated based on which Student we are creating 
//( design, code or network )




//Ova posldnovo ne mi e jasno sto se bara!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
//Create one of each students
//Check all students with the Student method for checking students academy
